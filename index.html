        2020 CALL FOR BELLINGHAM POLICE DIVESTMENT/COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT
        <br><br>
Defund BPD Coalition
<br><br>
2020 has brought to light the many challenges we face as a community. As a coalition we
recognize the vast injustices within our current systems, and call to action our elected officials
who have the power to effect change. It is our local government who must initiate alternative
methods to heal our racial and social prejudices systemically. We demand that the City of
Bellingham answer the call.
<br><br>
Per the national movement in Defense of Black Lives, we bring our attention to the Bellingham
Police Department’s 34 million dollar budget. This 36% of the city’s general budget is severely
inflated and must be divested, reallocating the funds to supporting community members left
behind. As such, the Defund BPD Coalition stands in solidarity with the demands laid out by the
national Black Lives Matter movement and local POC leadership calling for defunding the police
in Bellingham:
<br><br>
We call for at least a 50% cut to Bellingham Police Department funding for the 2021-22
budget and a reallocation of those funds towards community-led health and safety
systems, as well as other programs for community wellbeing.
<br><br>
We reject the argument that the City of Bellingham isn’t responsible for many services including
mental health and substance abuse programming, which is currently managed by Whatcom
County. We further reject the argument that the City of Bellingham has no effect on the entities
that control the education, housing and job security programs in our area. We urge city officials
to admit their laxity as complicity, and to restore their integrity and perceived good faith from the
community by realizing these demands.
<br><br>
We expect funding to be reallocated from BPD to these programs, in ways that may include
funding community organizations who can handle the infrastructure of program creation and/or
expansion.
<br><br>
OUTLINE OF SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS FOR COMMUNITY AID REINVESTMENT
<br><br>
We offer the following list of alternatives to policing: services that support our community through
caring and proactive, rather than punitive, systems.
Expanded mental health services:
<br><br>
We need a fully functioning mobile mental health crisis team outside of law enforcement that is
staffed 24 hours per day and serves people experiencing mental health, substance abuse and
domestic violence crises (similar to Eugene, Oregon’s CAHOOTS program). This would require
changing 911 dispatch policies so that the police are no longer the first responders for these
kinds of crises. We also call for an expanded mental health crisis stabilization center that can
meet the community’s mental health needs. Lastly, we demand funding for a mental health and
substance abuse peer support program.
<br><br>
Safe, secure, and affordable housing for our community:
<br><br>
We call for an end to sweeps, instead prioritizing health and safety for current encampments.
We need allocation for new spaces to host more tiny home villages. We also demand
renovations on currently unused buildings of 20 or more units for community members who are
without housing or at risk to lose housing, with paid staff to manage the buildings and provide
resources for tenants (per the demands of Homes Now!).
<br><br>
Expanded substance abuse treatment and harm reduction services:
<br><br>
We demand expansion of our mobile harm reduction program. Harm reduction services, such as
clean needle exchange programs, are low cost and effective ways to support the safety of our
community. Substance abuse treatment is also woefully inadequate for people who can’t afford
quality treatment. We call for funds to be allocated for creating an inpatient treatment facility for
people with co-occurring disorders. This program must use evidence-based treatment
modalities and be a free service for people who can’t afford treatment.
<br><br>
Community and Cultural Spaces for Black and Indigenous Folks:
<br><br>
We demand the creation of cultural and community spaces/centers for Black and Indigenous
members of our community: spaces that center Black and Indigenous voices, celebrate culture,
history, and connection. These spaces would strengthen and support communities that have
experienced systemic violence and oppression, as a means to provide resilient
community-building.
<br><br>
Supporting Black and Indigenous Economic Development:
<br><br>
We demand the creation of economic development services for Black and Indigenous people in
Bellingham. This would consist of creating an economic equity grant program for BIPOC
business incubation, as well as hiring a staff member as a liaison for BIPOC business
development and intergovernmental affairs. Black and Indigenous people have been
systematically disenfranchised, experiencing loss of land and hindrances to business
development, and types of harm which in Bellingham has included extreme displacement from
the region as well as extreme racial violence. Acknowledging this violent history means that we
owe black and indigenous community members reparations and material support for
developing economic self-sufficiency as a path towards reconciliation, self-determination and
sovereignty.
<br><br>
Expanded Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Services:
<br><br>
We demand funding to be allocated to services that support survivors of domestic violence and
sexual assault. We must expand shelter capacities and permanent housing. We need to
implement a restorative justice model for domestic violence and sexual assault cases, housed
outside of the legal system. We need to invest in accessible violence prevention education and
perpetrator treatment programs run by community organizations, rather than the legal system.
These programs will offer survivors the capacity to rebuild trust in community systems of support
enough to feel safe engaging in society.
<br><br>
Worker’s Cooperatives:
<br><br>
We demand the city to invest in the development of a worker’s cooperatives incubation program
that serves marginalized communities, including BIPOC, LGBTQ+ and economically oppressed
people. Worker co-ops not only can mitigate the regional effects of recession, serving as a
preventative measure towards keeping people from needing other emergency-based social
services, but they also tend to facilitate higher rates of business ownership by women, people of
color, and other systematically oppressed people. By destratifying organizational power and
empowering the communities who are akin to their service goals, worker co-ops reduce
inequality while building regional resilience to economic turbulence, and community resilience
through shared accountability for personal safety.
<br><br>
Food Sovereignty Programs:
Food Sovereignty is defined as “the right of peoples to healthy and culturally-appropriate food
produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their right to define their
own food and agriculture systems.” As such, it’s important we address both aspects of this
concept: 1) the right to food security and 2) the health and wellbeing of farmworkers.
We need to reallocate funds to programs that ensure citizens have access to affordable and
nutritious food with no strings attached. Though Bellingham Food Bank is a great resource for
able-bodied folks who have access to transportation and kitchen use, the lack of reliable access
to nutritious, ready-to-eat meals for marginalized people must be addressed. We demand a
program that brings prepared food to encampments and other places with high-density
homeless populations.
<br><br>
On the notion of sustainable food systems, we demand reallocation to the Community to
Community Development (C2C) Food Sovereignty Program. This funding will ensure that local
farmworkers are being properly compensated for their labor, as they are principal actors in our
economy and food production system.
<br><br>
Community Land Trusts:
<br><br>
Community Land Trusts are a way to ensure affordable housing for communities in perpetuity,
as well as create community equity, empowerment and engagement through active stewardship
of buildings and land. We urge the city to invest in the development and expansion of
community land trusts supporting local urban and rural land acquisition projects. These land
acquisitions can create more safe, inclusive and sustainable neighborhoods, commercial
spaces and community facilities. This is an innovative means to provide housing as well as
economic security, community development and public safety to the citizens of Bellingham.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion in Education and Youth Program Development:
We demand a diverse offering of youth and educational programming in Bellingham to bolster
the self-development, empowerment, and community and environmental engagement of
Bellingham’s youth. These must be offerings that help give youth more agency over their lives
and over their position in society, while also further ensuring access for youth of color. Likewise,
we demand Black and Indigneous programing and curriculum in the school system, developed
by members of those communities, allowing youth access to a fuller understanding of local,
regional, and global history.
<br><br>
Expansion of Early Childcare Education and Before & After School Care programs:
In support of the vision of the Child and Family Action Plan, County Council adopted the
following first action step: Establish new structures and processes to elevate the well-being
of all children and families as a county priority. This will require a richer understanding of who in
our community has access to opportunities and what structural barriers are in place preventing
certain children and families from full access to the thriving start. Children benefit in terms of
social, emotional and educational outcomes from attending early learning and childcare. This
echoes out to create sustainable families, where parents are able to maintain a stable
household and childcare workers have secure jobs.
<br><br>
The programs outlined above are examples of what would make our community truly equitable,
safe, and thriving. Our coalition continues to do research on each program, and we intend to
share more in-depth proposals offering examples of community groups or organizations that are
best equipped to enact these programs, as well as specific funding amounts. There are many
other community programs and ideas for how to use funds from the BPD budget in a way that
prevents crises and suffering, as well as promotes health, wellbeing, and prosperity for
marginalized communities, rather than arresting them. We expect you to listen to the needs and
ideas of the community when forming budgets. We look forward to receiving your response to
these demands.
<br><br>
